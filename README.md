# RNNvsHoltWinters
Is RNN better than traditional Holt Winters algorithm?

## Preparing the python environment

* Install cPython 3.8.5 from https://www.python.org/

* Download the project:\
git clone https://github.com/davidglt/RNNvsHoltWinters.git

* The Python requirements were exported with:\
pip freeze > requirements.txt
 
* Import it in your environment with:\
$ python3 -m venv <env_name>\
$ source path/to/<env_name>/bin/activate\
(<env_name>)$ pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
